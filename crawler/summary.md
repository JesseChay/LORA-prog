## LoRA Model Dataset Project Summary

**1. Data Validation and Cleaning**
- Extracted data from SQL database (8,709 models, 81,186 images)
- File format validation and processing:
 - Identified and processed non-image format files (e.g., MP4)
 - Detected and corrected mismatches between file extensions and actual formats
 - Standardized image formats (consider conversion to PNG or retaining original formats)
- Removed corrupted or unreadable files
- Handled duplicate data to ensure representative image samples for each model

**2. Image Preprocessing**
- Resized images to a uniform size (e.g., 224x224 or 299x299, depending on the chosen pre-trained model)
- Performed basic image enhancements:
 - Color normalization
 - Brightness and contrast adjustment
- Generated augmented versions for training (for subsequent contrastive learning tasks)

**3. Data Analysis**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
 - Analyzed statistics like model types, downloads, and likes
 - Visualized label distribution
 - Analyzed NSFW content distribution
 - Analyzed file format distribution
- Created a data distribution report to guide subsequent model training and evaluation

**4. Feature Extraction and Model Fine-Tuning**
- Initial Feature Extraction:
 - Used pre-trained CNNs (e.g., ResNet50 or EfficientNet-B0) to extract initial features
 - Extracted features for all 74,367 images, creating a baseline feature dataset
- Dataset Split:
 - Training set: 60% (approximately 44,620 images)
 - Validation set: 20% (approximately 14,873 images)
 - Test set: 20% (approximately 14,874 images)
- Model Fine-Tuning:
 - Implemented contrastive learning methods (e.g., SimCLR or MoCo v2)
 - Fine-tuned the model using the training set
 - Monitored performance on the validation set to avoid overfitting
- Re-extracted features for all images using the fine-tuned model

**5. Feature Evaluation and Optimization**
- Visualized feature distribution using t-SNE or UMAP
- Calculated and compared feature quality metrics before and after fine-tuning:
 - Intra-class vs. inter-class distances
 - Clustering performance (e.g., using K-means)
- Based on evaluation results, considered further model adjustments or feature extraction strategy optimizations

**6. Building the Retrieval System**
- Created a vector index using optimized features (e.g., using FAISS library)
- Implemented an efficient nearest neighbor search algorithm
- Designed and implemented a ranking mechanism, considering feature similarity, model popularity, and other factors

**7. System Integration and Testing**
- Integrated data processing, feature extraction, and retrieval modules
- Evaluated system performance on the test set:
 - Calculated Top-K accuracy, mean Average Precision (mAP), and other metrics
 - Conducted user experience tests to evaluate the relevance and diversity of retrieval results

**8. Documentation and Report Generation**
- Documented detailed steps of data processing and cleaning
- Generated dataset statistics report
- Recorded model fine-tuning process and parameter settings
- Summarized system performance and potential improvement points

**9. Continuous Improvement Plan**
- Designed incremental learning strategies to update the model with new data
- Established a regular performance evaluation and model updating mechanism
